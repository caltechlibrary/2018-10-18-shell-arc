title: "Shell Scripts"
teaching: 30
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I save and re-use commands?"
objectives:
- "Write a shell script that runs a command or series of commands for a fixed set of files."
- "Run a shell script from the command line."
- "Write a shell script that operates on a set of files defined by the user on the command line."
- "Create pipelines that include shell scripts you, and others, have written."
keypoints:
- "Save commands in files (usually called shell scripts) for re-use."
- "`bash filename` runs the commands saved in a file."
- "`$@` refers to all of a shell script's command-line arguments."
- "`$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc."
- "Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces in them."
- "Letting users decide what files to process is more flexible and more consistent with built-in Unix commands."

We are finally ready to see what makes the shell such a powerful programming environment.
We are going to take the commands we repeat frequently and save them in files
so that we can re-run all those operations again later by typing a single command.
For historical reasons,
a bunch of commands saved in a file is usually called a **shell script**,
but make no mistake:
these are actually small programs.

Let's start by going back to `molecules/` and creating a new file, `middle.sh` which will
become the shell script:

~~~
$ cd molecules
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

The command `nano middle.sh` opens the file `middle.sh` within the text editor "nano"
(which runs within the shell).
If the file does not exist, it will be created.
We can use the text editor to directly edit the file -- we'll simply insert the following line:

~~~
head -n 15 octane.pdb | tail -n 5
~~~
{: .source}

This is a variation on the pipe we constructed earlier:
it selects lines 11-15 of the file `octane.pdb`.
Remember, we are *not* running it as a command just yet:
we are putting the commands in a file.

Then we save the file (`Ctrl-O` in nano),
 and exit the text editor (`Ctrl-X` in nano).
Check that the directory `molecules` now contains a file called `middle.sh`.

Once we have saved the file,
we can ask the shell to execute the commands it contains.
Our shell is called `bash`, so we run the following command:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00
~~~
{: .output}

Sure enough,
our script's output is exactly what we would get if we ran that pipeline directly.

{: .callout}

What if we want to select lines from an arbitrary file?
We could edit `middle.sh` each time to change the filename,
but that would probably take longer than just retyping the command.
Instead, let's edit `middle.sh` and make it more versatile:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Now, within "nano", replace the text `octane.pdb` with the special variable called `$1`:

~~~
head -n 15 "$1" | tail -n 5
~~~
{: .output}

Inside a shell script,
`$1` means "the first filename (or other argument) on the command line".
We can now run our script like this:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh octane.pdb
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1      -4.502   0.681   0.785  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1      -5.254  -0.243  -0.537  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -4.357   1.252  -0.895  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -3.009  -0.741  -1.467  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -3.172  -1.337   0.206  1.00  0.00
~~~
{: .output}

or on a different file like this:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00
~~~
{: .output}

{: .callout}

We still need to edit `middle.sh` each time we want to adjust the range of lines,
though.
Let's fix that by using the special variables `$2` and `$3` for the
number of lines to be passed to `head` and `tail` respectively:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
~~~
{: .output}

We can now run:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 15 5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ATOM      9  H           1       1.324   0.350  -1.332  1.00  0.00
ATOM     10  H           1       1.271   1.378   0.122  1.00  0.00
ATOM     11  H           1      -0.074  -0.384   1.288  1.00  0.00
ATOM     12  H           1      -0.048  -1.362  -0.205  1.00  0.00
ATOM     13  H           1      -1.183   0.500  -1.412  1.00  0.00
~~~
{: .output}

By changing the arguments to our command we can change our script's
behaviour:

~~~
$ bash middle.sh pentane.pdb 20 5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
ATOM     14  H           1      -1.259   1.420   0.112  1.00  0.00
ATOM     15  H           1      -2.608  -0.407   1.130  1.00  0.00
ATOM     16  H           1      -2.540  -1.303  -0.404  1.00  0.00
ATOM     17  H           1      -3.393   0.254  -0.321  1.00  0.00
TER      18              1
~~~
{: .output}

This works,
but it may take the next person who reads `middle.sh` a moment to figure out what it does.
We can improve our script by adding some **comments** at the top:

~~~
$ nano middle.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# Select lines from the middle of a file.
# Usage: bash middle.sh filename end_line num_lines
head -n "$2" "$1" | tail -n "$3"
~~~
{: .output}

A comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments,
but they're invaluable for helping people (including your future self) understand and use scripts.
The only caveat is that each time you modify the script,
you should check that the comment is still accurate:
an explanation that sends the reader in the wrong direction is worse than none at all.

What if we want to process many files in a single pipeline?
For example, if we want to sort our `.pdb` files by length, we would type:

~~~
$ wc -l *.pdb | sort -n
~~~
{: .language-bash}

because `wc -l` lists the number of lines in the files
(recall that `wc` stands for 'word count', adding the `-l` flag means 'count lines' instead)
and `sort -n` sorts things numerically.
We could put this in a file,
but then it would only ever sort a list of `.pdb` files in the current directory.
If we want to be able to get a sorted list of other kinds of files,
we need a way to get all those names into the script.
We can't use `$1`, `$2`, and so on
because we don't know how many files there are.
Instead, we use the special variable `$@`,
which means,
"All of the command-line arguments to the shell script."
We also should put `$@` inside double-quotes
to handle the case of arguments containing spaces
(`"$@"` is equivalent to `"$1"` `"$2"` ...)
Here's an example:

~~~
$ nano sorted.sh
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
# Sort filenames by their length.
# Usage: bash sorted.sh one_or_more_filenames
wc -l "$@" | sort -n
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ bash sorted.sh *.pdb ../creatures/*.dat
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
9 methane.pdb
12 ethane.pdb
15 propane.pdb
20 cubane.pdb
21 pentane.pdb
30 octane.pdb
163 ../creatures/basilisk.dat
163 ../creatures/unicorn.dat
