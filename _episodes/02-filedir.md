keypoints:
- "The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk."
- "Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders)."
- "Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree."
- "`cd path` changes the current working directory."
- "`ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory."
- "`pwd` prints the user's current working directory."
- "`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system."
- "A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location."
- "An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system."
- "Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows."
- "`..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'."
- "Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories 
is called the **file system**.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called "folders"),
which hold files or other directories.

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.

First let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for "print working directory"). Directories are like *places* - at any time
while we are using the shell we are in exactly one place, called
our **current working directory**. Commands mostly read and write files in the 
current working directory, i.e. "here", so knowing where you are before running
a command is important. `pwd` shows you where you are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~
{: .output}

Here,
the computer's response is `/Users/nelle`,
which is Nelle's **home directory**:

> ## Home Directory Variation
>
> The home directory path will look different on different operating systems.
> On Linux it may look like `/home/nelle`,
> and on Windows it will be similar to `C:\Documents and Settings\nelle` or
> `C:\Users\nelle`.  
> (Note that it may look slightly different for different versions of Windows.)
> In future examples, we've used Mac output as the default - Linux and Windows
> output may differ slightly, but should be generally similar.  
{: .callout}

To understand what a "home directory" is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.  For the
sake of this example, we'll be
illustrating the filesystem on our scientist Nelle's computer.  After this
illustration, you'll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem,
which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.  

On Nelle's computer, the filesystem looks like this:

![The File System](../fig/filesystem.svg)

At the top is the **root directory**
that holds everything else.
We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;
this is the leading slash in `/Users/nelle`.

Inside that directory are several other directories:
`bin` (which is where some built-in programs are stored),
`data` (for miscellaneous data files),
`Users` (where users' personal directories are located),
`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and so on.  

We know that our current working directory `/Users/nelle` is stored inside `/Users`
because `/Users` is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

> ## Slashes
>
> Notice that there are two meanings for the `/` character.
> When it appears at the front of a file or directory name,
> it refers to the root directory. When it appears *inside* a name,
> it's just a separator.
{: .callout}

Underneath `/Users`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on Nelle's machine,
her colleagues the Mummy and Wolfman.  

![Home Directories](../fig/home-directories.svg)

The Mummy's files are stored in `/Users/imhotep`,
Wolfman's in `/Users/larry`,
and Nelle's in `/Users/nelle`.  Because Nelle is the user in our
examples here, this is why we get `/Users/nelle` as our home directory.  
Typically, when you open a new command prompt you will be in
your home directory to start.  

Now let's learn the command that will let us see the contents of our
own filesystem.  We can see what's in our home directory by running `ls`,
which stands for "listing":

~~~
$ ls
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Applications Documents    Library      Music        Public
Desktop      Downloads    Movies       Pictures
~~~
{: .output}

(Again, your results may be slightly different depending on your operating
system and how you have customized your filesystem.)

`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory. 
We can make its output more comprehensible by using the **flag** `-F`
(also known as a **switch** or an **option**) ,
which tells `ls` to add a marker to file and directory names to indicate what
they are. A trailing `/` indicates that this is a directory. Depending on your
settings, it might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or 
directory.
You might recall that we used `ls -F` in an earlier example.

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Applications/ Documents/    Library/      Music/        Public/
Desktop/      Downloads/    Movies/       Pictures/
~~~
{: .output}

Here,
we can see that our home directory contains mostly **sub-directories**.
Any names in your output that don't have trailing slashes,
are plain old **files**.
And note that there is a space between `ls` and `-F`:
without it,
the shell thinks we're trying to run a command called `ls-F`,
which doesn't exist.

We can also use `ls` to see the contents of a different directory.  Let's take a
look at our `Desktop` directory by running `ls -F Desktop`,
i.e.,
the command `ls` with the `-F` **flag** and the **argument**  `Desktop`.
The argument `Desktop` tells `ls` that
we want a listing of something other than our current working directory:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
data-shell/
~~~
{: .output}

Your output should be a list of all the files and sub-directories on your
Desktop, including the `data-shell` directory you downloaded at
the [setup for this lesson]({{ page.root }}{% link setup.md %}).  Take a look at your Desktop to confirm that
your output is accurate.  

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it's a self-defeating strategy.

Now that we know the `data-shell` directory is located on our Desktop, we
can do two things.  

First, we can look at its contents, using the same strategy as before, passing
a directory name to `ls`:

~~~
$ ls -F Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
data/                     fig_11_10.csv             humphrey_keeble_1976.pdf

fig_11_09.csv             habitat_03.jpg            van_leeuwen_2002.pdf
~~~
{: .output}

Second, we can actually change our location to a different directory, so
we are no longer located in
our home directory.  

The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
`cd` stands for "change directory",
which is a bit misleading:
the command doesn't change the directory,
it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.

Let's say we want to move to the `data` directory we saw above.  We can
use the following series of commands to get there:

~~~
$ cd Desktop
$ cd data-shell
$ cd data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

These commands will move us from our home directory onto our Desktop, then into
the `data-shell` directory, then into the `data` directory.  `cd` doesn't print anything,
but if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now
in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data`.
If we run `ls` without arguments now,
it lists the contents of `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data`,
because that's where we now are:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ ls -F
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
sample_01.csv  sample_03.csv  sample_05.csv  sample_08.csv  sample_10.csv
sample_02.csv  sample_04.csv  sample_07.csv  sample_09.csv
~~~
{: .output}

We now know how to go down the directory tree, but
how do we go up?  We might try the following:

~~~
$ cd data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
-bash: cd: data-shell: No such file or directory
~~~
{: .error}

But we get an error!  Why is this?  

With our methods so far,
`cd` can only see sub-directories inside your current directory.  There are
different ways to see directories above your current location; we'll start
with the simplest.  

There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level
that looks like this:

~~~
$ cd ..
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`..` is a special directory name meaning
"the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly,
the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell`:

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .output}

The special directory `..` doesn't usually show up when we run `ls`.  If we want
to display it, we can give `ls` the `-a` flag:

~~~
$ ls -F -a
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
./                        fig_11_09.csv             humphrey_keeble_1976.pdf
../                       fig_11_10.csv             lab_notes/
data/                     finches_01.jpg            lab_notes.zip
fig_11_01.csv             finches_02.jpg            loewenberg_1965.pdf
fig_11_02.csv             finches_03.jpg            oldroyd_1984.pdf
fig_11_03.csv             finches_04.jpg            olsen_2017.pdf
fig_11_04.csv             greenleaf_et_al_1998.pdf  pdfs/
fig_11_05.csv             habitat_01.jpg            readme for fig files.txt
fig_11_07.csv             habitat_02.jpg            van_leeuwen_2002.pdf
fig_11_08.csv             habitat_03.jpg
~~~
{: .output}

`-a` stands for "show all";
it forces `ls` to show us file and directory names that begin with `.`,
such as `..` (which, if we're in `/Users/nelle`, refers to the `/Users` directory)
As you can see,
it also displays another special directory that's just called `.`,
which means "the current working directory".
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

Note that in most command line tools, multiple flags can be combined 
with a single `-` and no spaces between the flags: `ls -F -a` is 
equivalent to `ls -Fa`.

These then, are the basic commands for navigating the filesystem on your computer:
`pwd`, `ls` and `cd`.  Let's explore some variations on those commands.  What happens
if you type `cd` on its own, without giving
a directory?  

~~~
$ cd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

How can you check what happened?  `pwd` gives us the answer!  

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle
~~~
{: .output}

It turns out that `cd` without an argument will return you to your home directory,
which is great if you've gotten lost in your own filesystem.  

Let's try returning to the `data` directory from before.  Last time, we used
three commands, but we can actually string together the list of directories
to move to `data` in one step:

~~~
$ cd Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd` and `ls -F`  

If we want to move up one level from the data directory, we could use `cd ..`.  But
there is another way to move to any directory, regardless of your
current location.  

So far, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using **relative paths**.  When you use a relative path with a command
like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location  from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.  

However, it is possible to specify the **absolute path** to a directory by
including its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash.  The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from
the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.

This allows us to move to our `data-shell` directory from anywhere on
the filesystem (including from inside `data`).  To find the absolute path
we're looking for, we can use `pwd` and then extract the piece we need
to move to `data-shell`.  

~~~
$ pwd
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
/Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell/data
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
$ cd /Users/nelle/Desktop/data-shell
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Run `pwd` and `ls -F` to ensure that we're in the directory we expect.

### Nelle's Pipeline: Organizing Files

Knowing just this much about files and directories,
Nelle is ready to organize the files that the protein assay machine will create.
First,
she creates a directory called `north-pacific-gyre`
(to remind herself where the data came from).
Inside that,
she creates a directory called `2012-07-03`,
which is the date she started processing the samples.
She used to use names like `conference-paper` and `revised-results`,
but she found them hard to understand after a couple of years.
(The final straw was when she found herself creating
a directory called `revised-revised-results-3`.)

> ## Sorting Output
>
> Nelle names her directories "year-month-day",
> with leading zeroes for months and days,
> because the shell displays file and directory names in alphabetical order.
> If she used month names,
> December would come before July;
> if she didn't use leading zeroes,
> November ('11') would come before July ('7'). Similarly, putting the year first
> means that June 2012 will come before June 2013.
{: .callout}

Each of her physical samples is labelled according to her lab's convention
with a unique ten-character ID,
such as "NENE01729A".
This is what she used in her collection log
to record the location, time, depth, and other characteristics of the sample,
so she decides to use it as part of each data file's name.
Since the assay machine's output is plain text,
she will call her files `NENE01729A.txt`, `NENE01812A.txt`, and so on.
All 1520 files will go into the same directory.

Now in her current directory `data-shell`,
Nelle can see what files she has using the command:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This is a lot to type,
but she can let the shell do most of the work through what is called **tab completion**.
If she types:

~~~
$ ls nor
~~~
{: .language-bash}

and then presses tab (the tab key on her keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for her:

~~~
$ ls north-pacific-gyre/
~~~
{: .language-bash}

If she presses tab again,
Bash will add `2012-07-03/` to the command,
since it's the only possible completion.
Pressing tab again does nothing,
since there are 19 possibilities;
pressing tab twice brings up a list of all the files,
and so on.
This is called **tab completion**,
and we will see it in many other tools as we go on.
