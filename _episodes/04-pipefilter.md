title: "Pipes and Filters"
teaching: 25
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I combine existing commands to do new things?"
objectives:
- "Redirect a command's output to a file."
- "Process a file instead of keyboard input using redirection."
- "Construct command pipelines with two or more stages."
- "Explain what usually happens if a program or pipeline isn't given any input to process."
- "Explain Unix's 'small pieces, loosely joined' philosophy."
keypoints:
- "`cat` displays the contents of its inputs."
- "`head` displays the first 10 lines of its input."
- "`tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input."
- "`sort` sorts its inputs."
- "`wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs."
- "`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`."
- "`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`."
- "`command > file` redirects a command's output to a file."
- "`first | second` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second."
- "The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters)."
